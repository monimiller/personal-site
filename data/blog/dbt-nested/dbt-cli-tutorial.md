If there's anything I despise, it is medium level decision making. Big decisions - no problem! _Pro and Con lists to the Rescue!_ Small decisions? Easy - I go with my gut and accept the difference between option A and option B is essentially negligible.

But, Medium decisions. Decisions that you may not have all the knowledge available at the time and run the risk of rework if you pivot. Those freak me out. What template should I use for my blog post when all my options integrate with VS Code and have great support communities? That took my four weeks of trial and error, just to end up with what I started on, six attempts later. **Medium decision making failure**.

So, the purpose of this post is to try consolidate all the information available so that those new to dbt can make an informed medium decision about your dbt environment of choice.
