Hi, y'all!

As I figure out what works best for my personal page, I am mixing it up a bit and am going to try writing my **Spotlight of the Week** articles separate from my topic specific articles for the next couple of weeks. I think this will allow me to dive into more detail for each spotlight and can also allow for easier search-ability on the blog post channel. My entire goal of these posts is to facilitate resource sharing, and I think that compartmentalizing the _SOTW_ content may help this mission. So stick with me as I try it out, and no one hold it against me if I decide to embark on another reorg before the ink has dried on the last one.

### What is Spotlight of the Week?

As we know, _Empowered Women Empower Women_. I plan to live out this mantra by amplifying one of my favorite things: women making their mark in tech. My goal each week is to highlight women I look up to, organizations I support, and general knowledge that I find interesting that pertains to this topic. Please reach out if you have an idea to share, a resource I don't know about yet, or any questions you have relating to any of these spotlights.

## YC Job Series Women Eng in Startups

This week, let's talk about my experience attending the [YC Job Series for Women Eng in Startups in 2021](https://www.workatastartup.com/events/yc-women-eng-in-startups-2021) sponsored by both YC and [Elpha](dbt-nested/dbt-cloud_release_notes.md) I attended this cohort last fall, and let me brag for a second over all the **BOSS WOMEN** I was introduced to and fangirled hard over. Even if you have absolutely no desire to join a startup, I still highly recommend looking out for future cohorts and signing up in order to hear career (& life) advice from some amazing individuals.
