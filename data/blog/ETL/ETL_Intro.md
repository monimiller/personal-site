I used to teach a DataStage class at USAA for new hires, and I was always _stunned_ at the amazing minds that came in with spectacular degrees that had little background knowledge about data concepts. To their credit, I had the same experience. Personally, I did not hear about ETL in the traditional classroom sense until my master's class in **Business Data Warehousing** and I have lots of feelings as to why modern day curriculum of all types will never stay in sync with actual job market experience. Nevertheless, I'd love to focus today on my experience with ETL and what the data movement architecture looks like in theory. Hopefully, this information can help achieve a basic understanding without paying $3,000 for a college course credit.

### Consider a Beautiful Birthday Cake

I am a sucker for Italian cream cake. My mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law share the title for **Best Elite Birthday Cake Makers** based on their ability to create a final product of sweet sweet goodness that rivals even the best chefs on _British Bake Off_. What they do involves magic, but we can use this example to relate to the magical final product of an accurate data output.
