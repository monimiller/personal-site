Hi, I'm Monica. I am a data engineer at USAA, and I am currently dipping my toe into what is the world of web development.  I am cuurently using the platform Vercel and trying out different formats that work for me. 

Here's some basic information about me.  I went to the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) for my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, where the highlight of my programming knowledge included creating for loops to make varying shapes using the asterisk key. With some luck involved, my junior year I landed an internship at USAA due to my love of sudoku, and was amazed by the job possibilities I didn't even know existed in the software space. I started my career post graduation (May 2019) in the data world and still reside there today.  In December of 2021, I achieved my Masters in Systems Engineering and Management also from UTD.  I am extremely thankful for that program because I got to take some classes relating to databases and business data warehousing, which gave me confidence that my on the job training was actually teaching me what the textbook would have.  

I have a cockapoo named Phoebe, a husband named Edmund, and the three of us all share a love of food, walks, and spending time with our family and friends.  

For fun, I'd love to play two truths and a lie with you! Go to my first blog post ever!! to see the answer. 
 - I played soccer in college and actually hold a conference record and a couple of school records.
 - I am deaf in my left ear and for a select period of time I wore a hearing aid to school. 
 - I have the same middle name as my mom because she wanted me to have names that related to both of my parents (Middle/Mom, Last/Dad).
