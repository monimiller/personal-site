        "description": "As organizations grow, Data Producers and Data Consumers lose touch and critical disconnections within the organization start to arise. Data Producers should not be held responsible for support they never agreed to, yet Data Consumers cannot be expected to own data from source systems they didn’t build. Consumers should have the power to define the schema they need instead of being forced to adapt to low-quality data. The answer? Data Contracts. Learn from Chad Sanderson, Chief Operator of Data Quality Camp, how data contracts can drive a cultural change toward data-centric collaboration resulting in well-modeled, high-quality, and trusted data.",

To achieve this desired result, you need to select two critical components of your lakehouse - a query engine and a table format. In this workshop, Jack Klamer and Monica Miller will lead you through how you can easily build and manage an open data lakehouse architecture using open-source technologies such as Trino and Apache Iceberg to support your growing analytics. Trino is an open source highly parallel and distributed query engine built from the ground up at Facebook for efficient, low-latency analytics. Iceberg is an open source, highly performant table storage format that enables an engine like Trino to perform data warehousing SQL functionality such as UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE commands on the data lakehouse. Jack and Monica will help you configure and build a sample data lakehouse, transform your data, highlight key Iceberg functionality, and produce a final output ready to be utilized by downstream consumers.",
