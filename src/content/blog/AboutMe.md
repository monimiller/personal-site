Hi, y'all!

Here we are, starting this journey. I know I introduced myself a little on the about page, but I wanted to expand on some of my favorite things about work and my true passions.

But first - let's play a game.

## Two Truths and a Lie

Which one is the lie?

1. I played soccer in college and actually hold a conference record and a couple of school records.
2. I am deaf in my left ear and for a select period of time I wore a hearing aid to school.
3. I have the same middle name as my mom because she wanted me to have names that related to both of my parents (Middle/Mom, Last/Dad).

Take a guess before scrolling down!

## The Teaching Bug

Since high school, I have loved teaching and mentoring others. Whether it's tutoring geometry, chemistry, or physics, this was always a role that brought me joy. This passion carried into college, where I was a TA for some Introduction to Mechanical Engineering classes.

As I started working at USAA, I'm very thankful the organization had opportunities for me to continue this type of teaching. I currently teach a two-day Datastage class to the New Hire Data Track three times a year - hands down my favorite kind of work days.

## Never Stop Learning

My desire for continuous learning has paired quite nicely with my technical career. Through my positions, I've had the opportunity to learn many new technologies and platforms: Datastage, Control-M, Gitlab, SQL, UCD, Unix, Snowflake, Nifi, dbt, and many others.

I've also been able to develop processes with these technologies and then teach what I've learned to my teams (and of course, write the documentation surrounding it).

I hope to find more opportunities for continued learning and teaching because I believe that we are all more successful together.

## Spoiler: The Answers

**#1 - TRUTH:** In a past life, I was a rockstar goalkeeper at UTD for the women's NCAA soccer team. Conference record holder, baby!

**#2 - TRUTH:** I didn't wear the hearing aids for long, but I did indeed wear them.

**#3 - LIE!** I am named after both of my parents, but my *first* name is my mom's middle name. My middle name is the spin-off girl version of my father's name.
