Season’s Greetings, Trino lovers! The holidays are right around the corner, and there’s no better way to celebrate than by joining us virtually on December 13th & 14th for this year’s [Trino Summit](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit2023/?utm_source=event&utm_medium=speaker&utm_campaign=NORAM-FY24-Q4-EV-Trino-Summit-2023&utm_content=23-trino-summit-starburst-blog). Our team at Starburst is thrilled to host this awesome event, and we are extremely excited to gather together the brightest minds in our community right before everyone’s end of year code freeze begins.

## Walking in a Speaker Wonderland

We’ve checked our list (twice!) and invited the most knowledgeable and inspiring speakers from across the Trino universe who are set to deliver talks that are guaranteed to brightly shine into the night. I am so excited to hear from our amazing [lineup of speakers](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit2023/?utm_source=event&utm_medium=speaker&utm_campaign=NORAM-FY24-Q4-EV-Trino-Summit-2023&utm_content=23-trino-summit-starburst-blog) who are ready and waiting to share their expertise with us all. We have some of the best Trino topics on deck such as polymorphic table functions, fault-tolerant execution, and increasing data lakehouse efficiency lined up from companies like Pinterest, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Quora, SK Telecom, and more!

I’m elated to see lots of familiar faces like Martin, Dain, David, Manfred, and Cole, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention some of the other awesome Trino contributors and Starburst co-workers I am excited to hear from. This year, we have many topics showing off Starburst collaborations and contributions to the Trino community such as the Trino Gateway work, where we will learn about the collaboration between Bloomberg, Starburst, Naver, and other Trino community members that led to the creation of Trino Gateway and plans for its future. We will also hear from Piotr Findeisen, Trino maintainer and Starburst Staff Software Engineer, who will educate us on the lessons learned from caching with Guava in Trino. It is truly exciting to see firsthand some of the tangible examples where Starburst is helping to build the Trino community.
