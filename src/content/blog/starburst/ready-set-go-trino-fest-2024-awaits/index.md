After our electric end to 2023 with an awesome [Trino Summit](https://www.starburst.io/info/trinosummit2023), the team immediately got to work planning our next Trino celebration, this time as a hybrid event. Starburst is excited to host Trino Fest on June 13th, 2024 both live in Boston and virtually anywhere around the world! We’ve heard your requests for another in-person event, and are excited to create a space for everyone to get together with fellow Trino lovers. If you can’t join us live, don’t worry. We will also be streaming the event and have plenty of activities planned so those joining us virtually can still participate in the fun.

At Starburst, we love celebrating Trino with the entire community, and are committed to creating a free event so those interested in Trino can share their knowledge with one another, learn with each other, and build together. We are excited to support the Trino Software Foundation, and all the future speakers and sponsors, to create an event that’s fun, educational, and worth your while.

## Joining us Live

Our event will be hosted at the Hyatt in Boston, where we are planning a full day of festivities followed by a happy hour at the Hyatt Regency deck. There is a [discounted room block](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/group-booking/BOSTO/G-STA4) set aside for those interested in attending live and staying with us in Boston.
