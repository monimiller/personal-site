It’s happening! Starburst is excited to act as the lead sponsor for the 2022 Trino Summit.

Join us online or in-person on November 10th, 2022 at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco as we gather the minds of those with one common passion: **Trino**. You can find all the relevant information on the [Trino blog](https://trino.io/blog/2022/06/30/trino-summit-call-for-speakers.html), including details about registration, call for speakers, and sponsorship opportunities.

In addition to hearing from some outstanding speakers, this year’s Trino Summit will bring together Trino experts and community members for a day of insightful discussion and Trino celebration.

We believe in Trino as a technology, so much so that we based our business on it. We also believe that a healthy community fosters innovation and collaboration; therefore, Starburst is committed to growing and enriching the Trino community.

Starburst wants to help facilitate a successful 2022 Trino Summit and offer our support to the Trino Software Foundation so that we can work together to plan the best community event possible. If you or your employer have any interest in helping us throw this awesome event, please [contact our events team for more information](mailto:events@starburst.io).

We know you are excited. We are too. To hold you over until the summit, go explore [Starburst Galaxy](https://www.starburst.io/platform/starburst-galaxy/), the cloud native and fully managed high performant query engine.

We look forward to seeing you in November, either in-person or online!
