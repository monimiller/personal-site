Hi, y'all!

As I figure out what works best for my personal page, I am mixing it up a bit and am going to try writing my **Spotlight of the Week** articles separate from my topic specific articles for the next couple of weeks. I think this will allow me to dive into more detail for each spotlight and can also allow for easier search-ability on the blog post channel. My entire goal of these posts is to facilitate resource sharing, and I think that compartmentalizing the _SOTW_ content may help this mission. So stick with me as I try it out, and no one hold it against me if I decide to embark on another reorg before the ink has dried on the last one.

### What is Spotlight of the Week?

As we know, _Empowered Women Empower Women_. I plan to live out this mantra by amplifying one of my favorite things: women making their mark in tech. My goal each week is to highlight women I look up to, organizations I support, and general knowledge that I find interesting that pertains to this topic. Please reach out if you have an idea to share, a resource I don't know about yet, or any questions you have relating to any of these spotlights.

## YC Job Series Women Eng in Startups

This week, let's talk about my experience attending the [YC Job Series for Women Eng in Startups in 2021](https://www.workatastartup.com/events/yc-women-eng-in-startups-2021) sponsored by both [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and [Elpha](/blog/sotw/elpha). I attended this cohort last fall, and there were so many amazing **BOSS WOMEN** I was introduced to and now act as an official fangirl of. Even if you have absolutely no desire to join a startup, I still highly recommend looking out for future cohorts and signing up in order to hear career (& life) advice from some brilliant individuals.

### Structure:

When I attended the cohort, it was a weekly commitment of two hours for four weeks and I thought this time block would drag on like one of my college night courses. Color me impressed because every session was engaging enough that I genuinely seemed surprised when we hit the two hour mark. Truthfully, I would have stayed even longer in the breakout rooms listening to the women share their firsthand experiences. The first hour was a proctored talk with keynote guests, and the second hour involved breakout room discussions which led to lots of open and honest conversation surrounding any question in mind.

### Favorite Topics of Discussion:

- Conversations about compensation and bridging the pay gap
- Advice about navigating maternity leave
- How to identify if a job change is right for you
- Tips from recruiters on how to stand out
- Personal experiences from current developers, managers, and founders
- Overcoming the gender disparity in the workplace
- How to work, mom, and wife at the same time
