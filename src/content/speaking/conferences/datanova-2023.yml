title: An introduction to data contracts
description: >
  As organizations grow, Data Producers and Data Consumers lose touch
  and critical disconnections within the organization start to arise. Data Producers
  should not be held responsible for support they never agreed to, yet Data Consumers
  cannot be expected to own data from source systems they didnâ€™t build. Consumers
  should have the power to define the schema they need instead of being forced to
  adapt to low-quality data. The answer? Data Contracts. Learn from Chad Sanderson,
  Chief Operator of Data Quality Camp, how data contracts can drive a cultural change
  toward data-centric collaboration resulting in well-modeled, high-quality, and
  trusted data.
