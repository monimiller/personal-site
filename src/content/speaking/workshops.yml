  title: "Not Your Father's Data Lakehouse: Building with Trino and Iceberg"
  description:
    The data lakehouse architecture has taken the analytics world by storm,
    applying critical data warehouse-like capabilities to the data lake. To achieve
    this desired result, you need to select two critical components of your lakehouse
    - a query engine and a table format. In this workshop, Jack Klamer and Monica
    Miller will lead you through how you can easily build and manage an open data
    lakehouse architecture using open-source technologies such as Trino and Apache
    Iceberg to support your growing analytics. Trino is an open source highly parallel
    and distributed query engine built from the ground up at Facebook for efficient,
    low-latency analytics. Iceberg is an open source, highly performant table storage
    format that enables an engine like Trino to perform data warehousing SQL functionality
    such as UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE commands on the data lakehouse. Jack and Monica
    will help you configure and build a sample data lakehouse, transform your data,
    highlight key Iceberg functionality, and produce a final output ready to be utilized
    by downstream consumers.
