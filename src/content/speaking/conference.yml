  title: An introduction to data contracts
  description:
    As organizations grow, Data Producers and Data Consumers lose touch
    and critical disconnections within the organization start to arise. Data Producers
    should not be held responsible for support they never agreed to, yet Data Consumers
    cannot be expected to own data from source systems they didn’t build. Consumers
    should have the power to define the schema they need instead of being forced to
    adapt to low-quality data. The answer? Data Contracts. Learn from Chad Sanderson,
    Chief Operator of Data Quality Camp, how data contracts can drive a cultural change
    toward data-centric collaboration resulting in well-modeled, high-quality, and
    trusted data.
