## Once upon a time

Once upon a time there was a girl who played soccer. She played so much soccer
that after years and years of playing, she now has a couple of D3 records to her
name. You guessed it, that girl is me. I am now
fully retired washed up fan who is strictly a spectator, but I still love the game, and I still love
watching anytime that I can. It doesn't hurt that I live in the United States,
where we have arguably the best women's soccer program in the world, so of
course it's fun to watch - especially international competitions. Because of my
sports background, I also have my own opinions about men's and women's equality
in sports, but I think one thing we can all agree upon is raising awareness for the
incredible women's athletes who are out there playing today. As a data girl
living in a data world, I thought what better way to do that than to pit myself
against a machine learning algorithm to see who wins. I'm not going to lie, I
am nervous for the outcome. I made my predictions like how I make all my
decisions, on blind gut instinct, so I am definitely feeling vulnerable about
sharing my
decision making with the ether and am looking forward to seeing
the results.

### The project premise and scope

My initial inspiration was strictly around utilizing some soccer data for one of
my example projects with Starburst. I started researching, and I found an
analysis performed by [Gustavo Santos](). Gustavo created a tremendous project
that I highly recommend checking out. I was able to essentially streamline my
own analysis from his prior work, so I want to say a major thank you to him. I
also want to give credit where credit is due - I really learned so much from his
analysis, and could not have replicated it on the women's side without his prior
work. That was my entire goal of this project, give the women's side some love
and do a simplified analysis from what Gustavo provided to share with the
community. My husband always likes to say that if your projects aren't
reproducible then they aren't real projects, so I have reproduced the ana
