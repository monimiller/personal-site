# Blog Content Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

Monica's blog posts are **personal, vulnerable, and conversational**. Think "chatting with a friend" not "corporate blog."

Key characteristics:
- First-person narrative ("I", "my", "we")
- Casual greetings like "Hi, y'all!" or "Here we are"
- Self-deprecating humor and honest vulnerability (imposter syndrome, learning journeys)
- Interactive elements welcome (games, questions to readers)
- Real personality shines through - not sanitized corporate speak

## Categories

Categories can be playful! Examples:
- `["blogging?", "blogging!"]` - totally valid
- Humor and personality in category names is encouraged

## Content Structure

- Personal anecdotes are the hook
- Technical content woven with personal experience
- Sign-offs that feel warm and genuine ("Thanks for reading!")

## What to Avoid

- Overly formal or stiff language
- Generic blog post structures
- Stripping personality for "professionalism"
- Removing humor or playfulness
