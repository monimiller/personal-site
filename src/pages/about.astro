            <p>
                I went to the University of Texas at Dallas for my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, 
                where I was introduced to programming through the classic exercise of creating shapes with asterisks. 
                My junior year, I landed an internship at USAA — partially because of my love for Sudoku — and was 
                amazed by the job possibilities I didn't even know existed in the software space.
            </p>

            <p>
                After graduating in May 2019, I started my career in the data world doing data movement and ETL pipelines. 
                In December 2021, I completed my Master's in Systems Engineering and Management, also from UTD. 
                I've spent my career being a continuous learner, soaking up knowledge about all things data and tech.
            </p>

            <p>
                These days, I work as a product manager but my heart is still in the data engineering trenches. 
                I love teaching, mentoring, speaking at conferences, and writing about my experiences in the data space.
