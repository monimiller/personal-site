            After being inspired by many individuals I admire, I decided to
            create my own website.

        <p class="description mx-auto mt-10 max-w-2xl text-center md:mt-20">
            Here's some basic information about me. I went to the University of
            Texas at Dallas (UTD) for my undergraduate degree in Mechanical
            Engineering, where I was introduced to programming through the use
            of loops to create various shapes using the asterisk key. My junior
            year I landed an internship at USAA, partially because of my love
            for Sudoku, and was amazed by the job possibilities I didn't even
            know existed in the software space. Ever since then, I have tried to
            be a continuous learner, and soak up all the knowledge I can related
            to all things tech. I started my career post-graduation (May 2019)
            in the data world and still reside there today, mostly doing data
            movement. In December of 2021, I achieved my Masters in Systems
            Engineering and Management also from UTD. I currently work at
            Starburst Data as a Developer Advocate, so please contact me with
            all your data needs and I can help get you connected with the right
            individuals.
